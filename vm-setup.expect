# It's not possible to boot into Raspbian in qemu normally because of a file in
# the image called "/etc/ld.so.preload", which loads a library that overrides the
# default memcpy implementation. It's called raspi-copies-and-fills.
#
# The following command patches this file by commenting the line. It's pretty
# fragile, as it relies on the first occurence of this string being the contents
# of the file /etc/ld.so.preload. So, yeah. Might need looking at when the base 
# raspbian image is updated.
